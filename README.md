## Description
  
Hello, this project is about using the backend to communicate with the front end. I created a sever that allows the user of the note taking app to save their notes after writing them and also have the option to delete the notes too if the user wanted. 
  
## Technology
  
Node.js, Express js, Heroku, Javascript, HTML, CSS

## Installation
*Make sure to have node.js and npm installed for this project*

To run this app on your end just clone my repo, open your favorite ide of choice (for me that is vs code), once it's open just run the command npm i, once the dependecy is downloaded, open server.js in your integrated terminal and type node server.js the console will give you a link that you can copy and paste into the browser for you to test the app for yourself. Or you can use the link I provided above to test out the app as well.
  
## Usage
  
To use this app just click get started on the front page and it will bring you to the note taker app, there you can type a title for your note and the content you would like that note to have. If you want to save your note just click the save button on the top right corner of the page. You can also delete the saved notes on the left hand side by clicking the delete button (it resembles a trash can).
  
## Credits
  
This project was fun to make! It taught me how to really make a server not only on my local host but also with a cloud provider. Heroku at first was hard to understand how to use but after looking online I found a seamless process to get my app on the web and it was very rewarding to see my app up and running. Again I do want to shoutout my class and there previous recordings for giving me an idea onto how to start the app aswell as how to commit my work along the way. I can see how it is important to try and keep a steady stream of commits. Overall this project was fun to make and it taught me a lot about how to operate the backend of a website.
